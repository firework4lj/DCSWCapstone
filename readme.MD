"# DCSWCapstone" 
Instructions for compilation and running:
Clone the repo to your computer with /git clone https://github.com/firework4lj/DCSWCapstone
For the Arduino code:
1.) Open in Arduino IDE
2.) Click verify, and then upload and run on an Arduino device. The console will display the input. HARDWARE REQUIRED.
For the monitoring code (DCSWMonitoringApp):
1.) Open the .sln file in Visual Studio
2.) Click "Start"
3.) Assuming the dependencies loaded correctly (I am unable to test without them as I have them on both computers I use) the monitoring app should open. If no hardware is connected, it will throw errors, and then display NULL for all the data points.
